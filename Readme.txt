To build the application, download the repository and open the 'Photo Album Display LT.sln' file in Visual Studio
and push the run button.

The console application will ask for a number to be input and will display any photo IDs and their associated titles from the
album that's number matches the input integer. The application will continue to prompt for an integer if you input any other
combination of characters. Once the requested information is displayed, the application will prompt for another numerical input. The application can be quit by inputting "Q" or "q".
